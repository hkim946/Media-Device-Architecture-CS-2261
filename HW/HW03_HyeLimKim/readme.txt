Basic Frog Game!

Controls:
UP (W), DOWN (S), LEFT (A), RIGHT (D)
SELECT (BACKSPACE): START, PAUSE

Control the "frog" (green square) to move around the moving "logs" (brown rectangles)
and reach the "land" (dark green) bar at the top in order to win! 
If the frog touches the logs at any moment in time, you will lose. 
CAREFUL! The logs are at random speeds, so make sure not to touch them! 

In order to start the game, press select, and you will be directed to the game.
If you would like to pause during the game, press select, and press select again to return back to the game. 
You will be returned to the original state you were in before you paused the game. 

If you would like to restart the game once you win or lose, press select again to return to the START state.
